Principal Stafford, and others who are CC'd,

Thanks for your response to my open records request in regard to the Charlie Kirk political text that was being used in the "Outdoor Adventures" course at Allen High School. This email is a follow-up to that response, which will hopefully illustrate some need for better oversight in terms of social media and political affiliations within the school district and its staff.

I would first note that all of this should not be read as any sort of threat or confrontation, but rather free advice from experience.  As I mentioned in my open records request I am a resident of Allen and my daughter is an Allen ISD graduate, so all of this is an attempt to help, not harm.

### My relevant background

I worked for the first web-based law library from 1999 to 2007 (at the time it was a property of [Wolters Kluwer](https://wolterskluwer.com), and we also served all of the content of their North American subsidiary, Aspen Publishers (since rebranded as [Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory](https://lrus.wolterskluwer.com/)) from a common datacenter), and most recently have been a founding member of the board and I.T. architect/consultant for the hurricane releief non-profit organization [Operation Airdrop](https://www.operation-airdrop.com). For those of you who keep up with local issues before the city council, I was also the person who investigated the fraudulent resume claims by Dr. Richard Bush after his 'shouting match' with council attendees that was in the Dallas Morning News [a couple of months ago](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2019/07/12/shut-up-i-m-talking-how-an-allen-council-meeting-became-a-shouting-match-amid-gun-range-debate/), all of which is detailed [here](https://holidayfordoc.github.io).

### Methodology

When this issue of a book written by Charlie Kirk being assigned to public high school students crossed my email the first thing that came to mind is that such information could make this school national news in a very bad way.  I'm sure I don't need to remind everyone that a mass shooter had national news crews hanging around in Allen just two weeks ago. I personally worked with the reporter who wrote the Washington Post story on that mass shooter in the week after that event, when neo-Nazis were planning a gathering in downtown Dallas that thankfully fizzled out into a not-newsworthy event.

Based on the initial information about the book being used in "Outdoor Adventures," I could immediately determine several things that *are* newsworthy:

1. The book is written by an alt-right political figure whose organization is known for [being associated with neo-Nazis](https://www.mediaite.com/online/watch-policy-advisor-for-trump-tied-america-first-group-praises-nazis/), and who is [known for trading in "fake news."](https://archive.li/8OGaV). The Communications Director from Kirk's organization mentioned in the Chronicle of Higher Education link has since been shamed for praising Adolf Hitler [in front of a congressional committee](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/candace-owenss-presence-turned-a-serious-inquiry-into-a-farce/2019/04/09/8e2976be-5b09-11e9-a00e-050dc7b82693_story.html). Nothing Charlie Kirk has ever written is worthy of being used in a classroom.
2. The teacher of the class has social media interaction [with Jack Posobiec](https://i.imgur.com/RJQYpyn.jpg), who also has ties to white supremacists and neo-Nazis. In late 2018 Posobiec hired [white supremacists associated with the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jeffrey-clark-dc-neo-nazi-arrested_n_5beb99ffe4b0caeec2bf24e5?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004&guccounter=1), one of which has since been [jailed for possessing illegal firearms, the other of which committed suicide](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/dc-man-arrested-on-gun-charge-after-relatives-alert-police-to-his-alleged-white-nationalist-outbursts/2018/11/13/e3a6d2fa-e771-11e8-b8dc-66cca409c180_story.html).
3. That Betsy Ross flag is a racist dog whistle in itself, and a good example of how these things evolve on social media.  White supremacists picked up on the Betsy Ross (oiriginal US flag with the 13 states in a circle) after Nike cancelled a shoe that planned to use that flag as a logo in July of 2019.  [Here's a 2013 article](https://www.albanyherald.com/news/former-klansman-reveals-secret-information-on-kkk/article_17048af1-b3da-5da7-8846-96340062af38.html) on a local KKK chapter in Georgia that uses the Betsy Ross flag interchangeably with the confederate flag, and a bit closer to home, [here are white supremacists in Denton](https://dentonrc.com/news/an-assault-and-reclaim-america-chants-denton-bars-have-troublesome/article_862981eb-bd5c-5be6-809d-2fe8a1bf2123.html) waving Betsy Ross flags outside of a bar they were kicked out of for coming in wearing and/or tattooed with swastikas recently. That organization is led nationally by a local named Thomas Rousseau who was present at the Charlottesville neo-Nazi rally in 2017 which resulted in multiple serious injuries and the death of Heather Heyer after a white supremacist drove his car through a crowd on the street. [American Identity Movement](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/betsy-ross-flag-nike-colin-kaepernick-patriot-movement-ku-klux-klan-854612/), the neo-Nazi group that organized the white supremacist gathering in Dallas [in the past two weeks](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2019/08/18/white-supremacist-group-says-it-protested-in-dallas-posts-videos-of-small-gatherings/) also use the Betsy Ross flag.

Is the Allen shooting team coach teacher a closet klansman?  I doubt that, but the case could be made well enough to write a news article about all of this so again, this is why the district needs a social media policy and needs someone enforcing that policy. High school teachers do not need to be friends with the alt-right on social media, because the likes and retweets of Jack Posobiec hating Colin Kaepernick today make that person look like a white supremacist tomorrow.  A [study published just last week](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08313) about the intersection between 'alt-lite' and white supremacist social media illustrates this pretty clearly. The day after that study was published, [Youtube saw fit to ban several](https://www.mediamatters.org/white-nationalism/youtube-removed-some-channels-affiliated-white-nationalism-not-all) of the people linked above.

Since Allen has increased scrutiny due to the El Paso mass shooter being from this city, the last thing the school district needs is a teacher who has visible association with alt-right media figures on social media, especially if that teacher is the shooting team coach.

The district needs a social media policy for all employees, and it needs to monitor and enforce that policy.
