## What's this about?

We have a bit of a [problem here in Allen, Texas](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/allen/2019/07/12/shut-talking-allen-council-meeting-became-shouting-match-amid-gun-range-debate){:target="_blank"}. In June of 2019, the city council approved the development of a property that would include a gun store and firing range on a parcel along the northern boundary of the city.

This in itself [is not very newsworthy](https://allen.novusagenda.com/agendapublic/CoverSheet.aspx?ItemID=8330&MeetingID=803){:target="_blank"} *([archive.is copy](http://archive.is/Tc5zb){:target="_blank"})*, but the aftermath of the vote was.

The proposal passed the city council by a vote of 6 to 1, and three people in favor of the proposed development attended and spoke at the subsequent meeting armed with pistols in a manner which can only be described as threatening to the one council person who voted against the proposal. The subject of the linked Dallas Morning News article above, a 'Dr.' Richard Bush, seems to be the organizer of this spectacle.

## Who is Dr. Richard Bush?

I place those facetious quotes around 'Dr.' for the following reasons. Bush describes himself on [his website](https://mindovermattercounseling.com/page2.php){:target="_blank"} *([archive.is copy](https://archive.is/CiyKe){:target="_blank"})* as a "Certified Clinical Hypnotherapist" specializing in "online hypnotherapy."  Despite his disclaimer suggesting that his counseling has [little or no verifiable benefit](https://mindovermattercounseling.com/page4.html){:target="_blank"} *([archive.is copy](https://archive.is/mM7ns){:target="_blank"})*, Bush does have a presence in the database of health care providers, he's listed as a [mental health counselor in the Health & Human Services database](https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/registry/provider-view/1154308195){:target="_blank"} *([archive.is copy](http://archive.is/r7EKf){:target="_blank"})*.

## LinkedIn

Bush's public [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-bush-8377b58){:target="_blank"} *([screenshot](https://holidayfordoc.github.io/linkedin.jpg){:target="_blank"})* suggests that he first went to grad school at Northern Arizona University, and completed a degree in "Human Relations and Behavior" slash-Counseling.  The slash-Counseling part is the kicker here, because "Human Relations and Behavior" [is an Education degree program at Northern Arizona University](http://catalog.nau.edu/Catalog/details?plan=HUMRELMED&catalogYear){:target="_blank"} *([archive.is copy](http://archive.is/q9fvh){:target="_blank"})*, not a medical one. Texas mirrors the national requirements for such a license as most states do.  Texas law specifically rejects education degree programs for consideration toward counselor licenses, and states that ["a counseling related field"](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/counselor/lpc_apply.shtm){:target="_blank"} *([archive.is copy](http://archive.is/1Cder){:target="_blank"})* is required. Furthermore, since we can see that Bush is claiming the hypnotherapy license as the basis for his LPC approval, the hypnotherapy board lists the Council of Higher Education as the acceptable accreditation for academic requirements toward their certification, but that accrediting agency does not list Bush's education master's degree as an accredited one [on their site](https://www.chea.org/northern-arizona-university){:target="_blank"} *([archive.org copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20190731072206/https://www.chea.org/northern-arizona-university){:target="_blank"})*.

## What about that Ph.D though?

Bush claims to have a Ph.D from Columbia Pacific University in "Psychology: Health and Human Services."  There's just one problem:

The state of California called Columbia Pacific University a "[giant scam... a diploma mill which has been preying on California consumers for too many years... The public is duped each time one of these worthless degrees is awarded](https://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Marin-Judge-Orders-University-in-Novato-To-Cease-2888658.php){:target="_blank"}" *([archive.org copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20190714210119/https://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Marin-Judge-Orders-University-in-Novato-To-Cease-2888658.php){:target="_blank"})*.  The state brought enforcement action against the school to forcibly shut it down in the mid 1990s.  All appeals were exhausted and it was forced closed by the state in 2000.  The school was never accredited.

A [federal investigation into unqualified government employees](https://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04771t.pdf){:target="_blank"} also mentions Columbia Pacific University, and notes that: 

> Employee #3, hired at NNSA in 2000, received a PhD in engineering administration in 1985 from Columbia Pacific University, an unaccredited school. He performed course work required for a PhD at George Washington University, a fully accredited school, but did not complete a dissertation. Employee #3 claims to have completed a dissertation for Columbia Pacific but did not attend classes or complete any coursework at that school. In December 1999, the Marin County Superior Court ordered Columbia Pacific University to cease operations within California. The court determined that Columbia Pacific failed to meet various requirements for issuing PhD degrees, awarded excessive credit based on life experience, and failed to employ duly qualified staff. 

The consumer watchdog site Quackwatch, which is run by a real, verifiable medical doctor has quite a bit of information on this fake university and some of its dubious graduates [here](https://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/News/cpu.html){:target="_blank"}. Dr. Barrett's site lists three others who claim the same Ph.D as 'Dr.' Bush, one of which by the name of John Dovelos ironically turns up on Google arguing with other people about...  fake online universities.  [Devos appeared to be using his fake Ph.D from Columbia Pacific University to promote another fake university](https://www.degreeinfo.com/index.php?threads/st-regis-will-not-be-listed-by-unesco-international-handbook-of-universities.8678/page-2#post-81691){:target="_blank"}.

## What about his claim of being a former Navy SEAL?

[In this address to the city council](https://youtu.be/vtMo865VoME?t=4240){:target="_blank"} Bush claims to be a former Navy SEAL, among other things. It seems that there's an entire industry involved in people claiming high-ranking military careers for the sake of civilian profit.  One (verifiable) former Navy SEAL, Don Shipley (interviewed [here](https://www.washingtonian.com/2015/08/30/if-youre-lying-about-being-a-navy-seal-veteran-don-shipley-will-catch-you/){:target="_blank"} in regard to the troublesome nature of exposing military frauds and individual privacy) has made the exposure of false military service claims a full time job.  I contacted him in regard to Richard Bush, and got the following response:

<blockquote>Sir,<br /><br />

I greatly appreciate your interest in upholding the honor of the US Navy SEAL Teams, and your search for the TRUTH. My efforts to expose SEAL imposters are performed as a service to the public, and in honor of my fallen SEAL Teammates, men who truly earned the right to the title “US NAVY SEAL” but who are no longer able to stand forward in defense of their honor, their reputations, and their TEAMs.
<br />
<br />
If the name you provided is spelled correctly, I do NOT find a listing in the SEAL Database (SEAL Teams, Underwater Demolition Teams and predecessor units from 1943 to the Present Day) for anyone named RICHARD BUSH. I have also examined possible alternate spellings, and names with similar pronunciations without finding any that appear to be applicable.
<br />
<br />
Unless he has undertaken the unlikely action of a legal name change, an action for which there would be evidence in the form of court documentation) since his claimed participation in SEAL training, and based upon the information you have provided, I can state conclusively that RICHARD BUSH NEVER COMPLETED SEAL TRAINING, and he is not now, nor was he ever a Navy SEAL or a Navy Underwater Demolition Team member.
</blockquote>

[Here](https://holidayfordoc.github.io/seal-response.jpg){:target="_blank"} is a screenshot of the email response from Don's wife, Carol, who processes these verification requests against a database they maintain of present and former SEALs.

Further investigation from Don and Diane into Bush's military history seems to clarify things a bit. 

People discharged from military service receive a form number DD-214 which is kept on file by the federal government as proof of their service record. These records are not private, [anyone can pull them via a FOIA request](https://holidayfordoc.github.io/dd214.jpg){:target="_blank"}. Bush's DD-214 says he was in the U.S. Navy for a whopping 72 days.

A sample of the video Don has put together on Bush's false military claims is [here on Don's website](https://videos.extremesealexperience.com/movie_Phony-Navy-Seal-Of-The-Week-Dr-Richard-Orville-Bush-Allen-Texas-The-Dead-Horse-Kicker-Phony-Seal){:target="_blank"}.

[Here](https://holidayfordoc.github.io/dd214-1.jpg){:target="_blank"} and [here](https://holidayfordoc.github.io/dd214-1.jpg){:target="_blank"} are copies of Bush's DD214 discharge form, showing the details of his military service. He never graduated from basic training.

[Here](https://holidayfordoc.github.io/bush-shipley.mp4){:target="_blank"} (warning: NSFW language toward the end) is another excerpt from a video Don Shipley put together, featuring Bush for the last week of July, 2019 as the "Fake Navy SEAL of the Week" on his website, with the relevant council speech included.  Subscribers to Shipley's website can see the full video, which is over 12 minutes in length and includes a phone call with Bush.
